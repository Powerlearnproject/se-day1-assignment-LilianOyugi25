#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
creation, development and maintenance of software systems It involves the application of engineering principles, techniques, and methodologies to the software development lifecycle, including requirements

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.Structured Programming (1960s-1970s)
Move away from unstructured code (spaghetti code) to organized and modular programming.
Introduction of control structures (if-else, loops), subroutines, and data structures.
Aim: Improve readability, maintainability, and reduce errors.
2.. Object-Oriented Programming (1980s-1990s)

Shift from procedural programming to encapsulating data and behavior within objects.
Introduction of classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Aim: Enhance code reusability, flexibility, and extensibility.
Led to the rise of modern programming languages like Java and C++.

Agile Software Development (2000s-Present)
Focus on iterative development, continuous feedback, and team collaboration.
Introduction of frameworks like Scrum and Kanban.
Aim: Accelerate software delivery, respond to changing requirements, and improve team productivity.
Shift from waterfall models (linear development) to more adaptive and iterative approaches.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
PHASES OF SDLC
1. Planning – This initial phase involves defining the project scope, objectives, feasibility, and potential risks. It helps in resource allocation and creating a roadmap for development.

2. Requirement Analysis – Stakeholders and developers gather and document software requirements, ensuring they align with business needs. This phase often includes functional and non-functional requirements.

3. Design – The software architecture is planned, including UI/UX design, system architecture, database design, and technology selection. This phase ensures a structured approach to development.
4. Development (Coding) – Programmers write the actual code based on the design specifications. This phase involves frontend and backend development, following coding standards and best practices.
5. Testing – The software undergoes rigorous testing, including unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing, to identify and fix bugs before deployment.
6. Deployment – The software is released to the production environment, making it accessible to users. This can be done in phases (e.g., beta testing) or as a full-scale launch.

7. Maintenance and Support – After deployment, developers provide updates, fix issues, and improve functionality based on user feedback to keep the software relevant and efficient.
   
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall follows a linear and sequential approach, where development progresses through well-defined phases: Planning → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance. Agile, on the other hand, is **iterative and incremental, cycling through small sprints with continuous feedback and improvements.  

Waterfall is rigid, meaning changes are difficult once development starts, whereas Agile is highly flexible and adapts to evolving requirements. Waterfall involves **minimal client involvement after requirements are set, while Agile encourages high client collaboration throughout the process  

Testing in Waterfall is done at the end of development, whereas Agile involves continuous testing in each iteration. Waterfall also requires heavy documentation before development, while Agile focuses more on working software with lightweight documentation.  

Waterfall is best for large, well-defined projects with clear requirements, while Agile is ideal for dynamic projects where requirements may change frequently 

Examples of When to Use Each Methodology
1. Waterfall – Building a Hospital Management System
   - Hospitals require structured, well-documented software with clear compliance requirements. Waterfall ensures all phases, from planning to deployment, follow a strict sequence with minimal changes.
  
   - Agile – Developing an E-commerce Website
E-commerce platforms need continuous updates based on user behavior and market trends. Agile allows iterative development, enabling regular testing, feature improvements, and quick adaptation. 

3. Waterfall – Government Tax Processing System 
   - Tax systems require stability, accuracy, and regulatory compliance. Waterfall ensures a well-documented, thoroughly tested system before launch, minimizing errors and risks.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer

Roles:
Design, code, and test software applications
Collaborate with other team members to ensure code quality and functionality
Stay updated on the latest software development technologies and practices
Quality Assurance Engineer (QA Engineer)

Roles:
Ensure the quality and usability of software products
Identify and report bugs and defects
Propose and implement improvements to software development processes

Responsibilities:
Developing and executing test plans
Writing test cases and automating tests
Conducting regression testing and performance testing
Reporting and tracking bugs
Collaborating with developers to identify and resolve issues
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Project Manager
Roles:
Plan, execute, and track software development projects
Manage project scope, budget, and timelines
Lead and motivate team members
Communicate with stakeholders and report on project progress

Responsibilities:
Creating project plans and timelines
Assigning tasks and managing resources
Tracking project progress and reporting on status
Facilitating meetings and communicating with stakeholders
Managing risks and addressing project challenges
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing checks individual components for correctness. Integration testing ensures modules work together. 
System testing validates the entire application against requirements.
Acceptance testing confirms it meets user needs. These ensure software reliability, functionality, and user satisfaction before deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting effective inputs to optimize AI responses. It enhances accuracy, relevance, and efficiency when interacting with AI models, making them more useful for tasks like content generation, data analysis, and problem-solving.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt: "Tell me about climate change."  
Improved prompt: "Explain how human activities contribute to climate change, focusing on greenhouse gas emissions and their impact on global temperatures."  

The improved prompt is more effective because it specifies the aspect of climate change to be addressed (human activities), provides a clear focus (greenhouse gas emissions), and defines the expected scope (impact on global temperatures), leading to a more precise and relevant response.
